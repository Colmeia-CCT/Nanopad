# Nanopad
A small project that aims the use of the site _dontpad.com_ through the Linux terminal using python.

One of the main goals of the project was to the students involved to learn how to make a program in python that interact with the internet.

**Dependencies**
Nanopad.py requires the libraries:
```
requests
bs4
os
hashlib
```
of which only _bs4_ needs to be installed via pip3 on the PC or _bs4_ and _requests_ in the case of more minimal linux terminals like Termux.

**How to use**
Execute on the linux terminal to open the program:
```
Python3 nanopad.py
```
Then you will be welcomed with the options of the software, like the option to encrypt the URL in various types like SHA-256.
